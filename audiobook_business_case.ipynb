        "\n",
        "The main idea is that if a customer has a low probability of coming back, there is no reason to spend any money on advertising to him/her. If efforts are focused SOLELY on customers that are likely to convert again, great savings can be made. Moreover, the objective is to identify the most important metrics for a customer to come back again. Identifying new customers creates value and growth opportunities.\n",

        "These are the inputs (excluding customer ID, as it is completely arbitrary. It's more like a name, than a number).\n",
        "\n",
        "The targets are a Boolean variable (0 or 1). Data is available for a period of 2 years based on which predictions will be done. \n",
        "\n",
        "So,aim is to find if: based on the last 2 years of activity and engagement, a customer will convert in the next 6 months. If they don't convert after 6 months, chances are they've gone to a competitor or didn't like the Audiobook way of digesting information. \n",

        "The task is : create a machine learning algorithm, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again. \n",
